# Flappy
## This is a project to explore a little bit more about the pygame framework, also learn how to work with NEAT AI algorithms.


## Run the game in your computer
#### To run the game in your computer, you need to make sure that the following Python Modules are installed in your virtual container or actuall machine:
- 1 -> Pygame; To install, run the following on your bash terminal:
  ```bash
  pip3 install pygame
  ```
  If your running Python 3.7+ or else; and:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```
  If your runing Python2.7-.
- 2 -> NEAT; To install, run the following on your bash terminal:
  ```bash
  pip3 install neat-python
  ```
  If your running Python 3.7+ or else; and:
  ```bash
  pip install neat-python
  ``` 
  If your runing Python2.7-.
  
### After being sure you have the modules installed, run the following command on your bash:
```bash
python3 flappy_bird.py
```
  If you've done everything correctly, and if everything worked well, you should have the game playing for it self. Feel free to play with the code and watch the results. 
  I also encourage you to change the code to make it a full playable game. GLHF! Or should I say, Good Work Have Fun :)
